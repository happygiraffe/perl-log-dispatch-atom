=head1 NAME

Log::Dispatch::Atom - Log to an atom feed.

=head1 VERSION

This document describes Log::Dispatch::Atom version 0.01

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Log::Dispatch::Atom;

    my $log = Log::Dispatch::Atom->new(
        name      => 'foo',
        min_level => 'debug',
        file      => 'file.atom'
    );
    $log->log_message( level => 'error', message => 'A problem happened' );
    $log->log_message( level => 'debug', message => 'Got Here' );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class implements logging backed by an Atom feed so that you can
subscribe to the errors produced by your application.

You should not use this object directly, but should manage it via a
L<Log::Dispatch> object.

=head1 IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

In order to safely write to the log file, the entire file must be locked
each time that an entry is logged.  This probably makes it unsuitable
for high volume log files.

The log file is opened and closed on each call to log_message().

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item new()

Takes a hash of arguments.  Returns a new Log::Dispatch::Atom object.
The following parameters are used:

=over 4

=item I<name> [mandatory]

The name of the logging object.

=item I<min_level> [mandatory]

The minimum logging level this object will accept.  See L<Log::Dispatch>
for more information.

=item I<max_level> [optional]

The maximum logging level this object will accept.  See L<Log::Dispatch>
for more information.  The default is the highest possible level (ie: no
maximum).

=item I<file> [mandatory]

Specifies the location of the file to read/write the feed from.

=item I<feed_id> [optional]

Specifies the identity of the feed itself.  Normally, this should be
set to the published URI of the feed.

If not specified, it will be omitted, which is in violation of the
Atom specification.  For more information, see
L<http://www.atomenabled.org/developers/syndication/#requiredFeedElements>.

=item I<feed_title> [optional]

The title of the feed.  This should probably be set to the name of
your application.

If not specified, it will be omitted, which is in violation of the
Atom specification.  For more information, see
L<http://www.atomenabled.org/developers/syndication/#requiredFeedElements>.

B<XXX> This should probably just use the I<name> parameter.  What do you
think?  Let me know.

=item I<feed_author> [optional]

The author details of a feed.  This is specified as a hash reference,
which must contain one or more of the three keys I<name>, I<email> and
I<uri>.

In order to create a valid Atom feed, you must either supply an author
in every single entry (log message), or ensure that the feed itself has
an author.  The latter is probably the easier solution, so I recommend
this parameter be supplied.

=back

=item log_message()

Takes a hash of arguments.  Has no return value.  The following
parameters are used.

=over 4

=item I<message> [mandatory]

The actual log message.

=item I<level> [mandatory]

The level of the message.  See L<Log::Dispatch> for a full list.

=item I<id> [optional]

Each entry requires an id in order for the feed as a whole to be a valid
Atom document.  It's used by readers of Atom documents to determine
whether or not an entry has been seen previously.

If not specified, this will default to an URL comprising the current
time plus the pid plus the hostname plus a monotonically increasing
integer.  eg: tag:fred.example.com,2005-12-07:1133946771/20827/2.  This
should be good enough for a uniqueness test.

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<XML::Atom>, the module used for Atom processing.

The spec for the atom syndication format,
L<http://www.atomenabled.org/developers/syndication/>.

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

L<XML::Atom> version 0.15.

This module uses flock() to the lock the feed file whilst it's writing,
so your version of Perl will need support for that.
